Decided to make user level application a python application. Following list are
action items that were discussed:

1. Cross compile Linux to Raspberry Pi Zero W successfully
2. Aggregate a list of popular Bluetooth devices in public 
3. Research BT profiles we can take advantage of
4. Develop a core application to handle plugin modules/features we develop later
5. Integrate Matt's code with user application and kernel module logging
    1. Modified kernel module should have ioctl calls to handle from application
6. Researching and documenting behavior with spoofed devices.
    1. Can we deauth paired devices?
    2. What are the different behaviors between BT Classic and BLE
